Attendance Tracker System

System Description

The Attendance Tracker System is a small automation project built using Bash and Python.
It helps create a structured attendance project folder, read student attendance data from a CSV file, calculate attendance percentages, and generate alerts for students whose attendance is below a defined threshold.
The system is designed to demonstrate:

Bash scripting automation
File and folder management
JSON configuration handling
CSV data processing
Logging and conditional alerts in Python

How the System Works
1️⃣ Setup Phase (Bash Script)

When you run the Bash script.
It asks for a project name.
It creates a project folder.
The script also.

Allows updating attendance warning and failure thresholds.
Checks if Python3 is installed.
Automatically generates sample student data.
If the script is interrupted (Ctrl + C), it safely archives the project before exiting.

How to Use the System

Enter a project name when prompted.
(Optional) Update attendance thresholds.
Navigate into the created folder and run
Check the results inside
